    "> Jobify was our capstone project in the computer science program at Del Norte High School. In a team of 10, we collaborated to deliver a cohesive product which helps students with all their needs in one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "I focused on the holistic development of assignments, issues, and their connection to many other features such as grades and accounts. At Jobify, I practiced complexity in my APIs which required many endpoints and unique data structures. For assignments, I required 3 models all containing additional HashMap fields. The backend was accomplished in Spring. To deliver a comprehensive experience, I also focused on connecting my work with my collages and on building an easy-to-use frontend.\n",

    "I focused on the car location system. This system on the backend was responsible for managing the location of all the cars, and for assigning new users a car when they join a race. I also created the code behind moving the cars, which updated the cars location based on a ticking system and posted to my api when the user typed a line of code.\n",

Next, the frontend uses JavaScript and JQuery to create each post in HTML. You may click the like/dislike buttons to change the likes and the flag to remove a post from the database. The database was made with Flask\n",
