    "I tried to keep track and document everything with issues. They can be seen [here](https://github.com/BobTheFarmer/VACTQ-Typing-Game/issues). \n",
    "\n",
    "- [Sign in page](https://github.com/BobTheFarmer/VACTQ-Typing-Game/issues/7): Documents the first thing I worked on for frontend, a basic wireframe for a sign in page. We did not end up using this.\n",
    "- [Game Control Loop](https://github.com/BobTheFarmer/VACTQ-Typing-Game/issues/5): This issue shows how I built the game loop, which updates the positions of all the cars from API data. This script is center to connecting the frontend and backend. \n",
    "- [Typing System](https://github.com/BobTheFarmer/VACTQ-Typing-Game/issues/9): Shows the typing system and the process used to make it. It also shows the API connection, but that part was added later.\n",
    "- [Fixing the Backend Issues](https://github.com/BobTheFarmer/VACTQ-Typing-Game/issues/6): We had some problems deploying the backend and this documents how I fixed it.\n",
    "- [Phrases API](https://github.com/BobTheFarmer/VACTQ-Typing-Game/issues/8): I changed the jokes API to contain phrases instead to be used in the game.\n",
    "- [Players API](https://github.com/BobTheFarmer/VACTQ-Typing-Game/issues/11): I had to redo the players API because we were having a lot of problems fixing bugs. \n",

    "# Summary of my most important work\n",
    "\n",
    "# Game Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The frontend needs a central script to update the positions of the cars from the API data. It's also important that this script is well-connected both to the animation and the backend, acting as the connector. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Use of OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to store the position data in an object that mirrors the backend objects. This will make the process of updating the player positions easier. The Player object needs to do four things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Store the index of each player\n",
    "- Store the progress of each car along the track (to be pulled from backend)\n",
    "- Update the position of the cars by being passed JSON data\n",
    "- Reset the progress of the cars\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "  class Player {\n",
    "      constructor(index) {\n",
    "          this.progress = 0;\n",
    "          this.index = index;\n",
    "      }\n",
    "      \n",
    "      reset() {\n",
    "          this.progress = 0;\n",
    "      }\n",
    "  \n",
    "      update(positionData) {\n",
    "          this.progress = positionData[this.index];\n",
    "      }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the update takes all the JSON data and interprets it rather than just take its own data.  That will make the code more concise and easier to write later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ticking system\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid inconsistencies in how fast positions are updated depending on connection speed, I used a ticking system to only call the API over some interval. A constant is used to make this interval easily adjustable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "const tickRate = 1000;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "function tick() {\n",
    "    updatePositions(getAPIData());\n",
    "\n",
    "    //Update cars animations\n",
    "    \n",
    "}\n",

    "```\n",
    "# Typing System\n",
    "\n",
    "## API Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "I used async requests to update the position of the cars. Here's what that looks like: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "async function updatePosition(index, pos) {\n",
    "    const url = `localhost:8085/api/ptest/move/${index}/${pos}/`;\n",
    "    try {\n",
    "        const response = await fetch(url, {\n",
    "            method: 'POST', // or 'PUT'\n",
    "            headers: {\n",
    "                'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n",
    "            },\n",
    "        });\n",
    "        if (!response.ok) {\n",
    "            throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        const data = await response.json();\n",
    "        return data;\n",
    "    } catch (error) {\n",
    "        console.error('There has been a problem with your fetch operation:', error);\n",

    "# Fixing the backend issues\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using GitLens to fix it\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Mort also showed me how to use GitLens to investigate this further. GitLens is an extension in vscode which allows you to easily back up to previous commits. We used this to find that going back a couple of weeks allows the backend to run correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How I will avoid mistakes like this in the future\n",
    "\n",
    "I wasted a lot of time investigating the jwt error, but it turned out it was not important to the overall problem. In the future, I will be more careful not to blindly follow the error but read it carefully and take a more direct approach to the problem, rather than just look for anything related to the error in the code. I will also not be afraid to ask for help if I get stuck on something like this. \n",
