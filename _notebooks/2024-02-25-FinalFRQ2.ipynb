    "After a guess is made, the player is given a hint that is based on a comparison between the hidden word and the guess. Each position in the hint contains a character that corresponds to the letter in the same position in the guess. The following rules determine the characters that appear in the hint.\n",

    "| also in the hidden word, but in a different position, |  '+' |\n",
    "| not in the hidden word,  |  '*' |\n",
    "\n",
    "The HiddenWord class will be used to represent the hidden word in the game. The hidden word is passed to the constructor. The class contains a method, getHint, that takes a guess and produces a hint.\n",
